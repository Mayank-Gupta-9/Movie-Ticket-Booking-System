# Movie-Ticket-Booking-System
This program is a movie ticket booking system using C++(OOPS) and MySQL. It connects to a database to manage seat reservations. The Seats class initializes a seating chart, checks seat status, and reserves seats. The main function handles database connections, creates a Ticket table, and provides a menu for users to reserve seats or exit.
