# Movie-Ticket-Booking-System
This C++ program is a movie ticket booking system integrated with a MySQL database. It connects to the database to manage and update seat reservations. The `Seats` class initializes a 5x10 seating chart, checks seat status, and reserves seats by updating the database. The main function establishes a database connection, creates a `Ticket` table if it doesn't exist, and provides a user interface with options to reserve a seat or exit the program. The system updates the seating status in the database and reflects changes in real-time, ensuring accurate seat availability for users.
